Execution:
1. In the Solution Explorer (right corner), right-click UnitTest.cs
2. Click "Run Tests"

Technologies:
C# .NET - The language and framework I am most familiar
Selenium - A powerful framework for testing web applications
Chrome Webdriver - For driving the automation in Google Chrome. Used Google Chrome since it is one of the big five browsers.
NUnit - Most popular unit test framework for .NET
NewtonSoft.Json - Used for parsing the service response into a JSON object. I did some string manipulation in order for the service response to be accepted as a JSON Object. Once the service response is in a JSON Object, it is easier to access the data.
